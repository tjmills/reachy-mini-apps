"""Reference docs for Reachy Mini app development.

This package is not runtime code. It exists to store guidance for building
Reachy Mini apps and using the SDK in this workspace.

Key sources:
- SDK API and docs live in the upstream `reachy_mini` repo or your installed package.
- App patterns (camera/audio threads, shutdown, settings UI) live in the
  `reachy_mini_conversation_app` repo.
